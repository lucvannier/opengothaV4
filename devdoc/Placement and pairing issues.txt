Placement and pairing issues
****************************
updated 02/01/2009

Placement and pairing informations are stored in ScoredPlayer object
ScoredPlayer inhérits Player and contains 3 additional groups of information :
- Base scoring info with all placement values for all rounds, but without dc and sdc (Direct confrontation)
- Direct confrontation placement values. These values are relevant for the current round.
- Pairing info.
Moreover ScoredPlayer contains gps, a GeneralParameterSet data member,
which determines some of the placement and pairing info like Mac-Mahon scores.

- Base scoring info is updated by Tournament.fillBaseScoringInfoIfNecessary
- Direct confrontation is updated by Tournament.fillDirScoringInfo
- Pairing info is updated by Tournament.fillPairingInfo

- Tournament.fillBaseScoringInfoIfNecessary is invoked by 3 Tournament methods
- Tournament.fillDirScoring is invoked by Tournament.orderedScoredPlayersList
- Tournament.fillPairingInfo is invoked by Tournament.makeAutomaticPairing
